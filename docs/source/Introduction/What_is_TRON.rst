What_is_TRON?

TRON operates as a decentralized blockchain platform for supporting smart contract and high throughput. TRON team sees it as a future operation system which allow developers deploying their own decentralized applications.

* Digital Asset Function with Chain Embedded
Rather than simply stress "lacking in characteristics”, TRON mainly focus on user-friendliness of different functions. For example, after fully research of current market, the develop team of TRON found that there are many decentralized platform users who do not have programming skills but have rich intrinsic value. They cannot convert their intrinsic value into external entities because of high threshold and versatility of existed smart contract. This is the reason why TRON team embeds custom digital asset functions into the main chain instead of actualizing functions in the form of smart contracts. This can be more easily and directly to achieve a number of indicators such as user-friendliness, safety, and so on.

TRON：The Internet as it was meant to be
========================================

TRON is an ambitious project dedicated to building the infrastructure for a truly decentralized Internet. The Tron Protocol, one of the largest blockchain based operating systems in the world, offers scalable, high-availability and high-throughput support that underlies all the decentralized applications in the TRON ecosystem. TRON enables large-scale development and engagement. With over ten thousand transactions per second, high concurrency, low latency and massive data transmission, TRON is ideal for building decentralized entertainment applications. Free features and incentive systems allow developers to create premium app experiences for users. TRON Protocol and the TVM allow anyone to develop DAPPs for themselves or their communities, with smart contracts making decentralized crowdfunding and token issuance easier than ever. Tron DAPP projects already include Peiwo, Uplive, game.com, Kitty live and Mico,  with 100M+ active users from more than 100 countries and regions around the world.
