What is a Super Representative
##############################

Token holders in the TRON community fall into the following categories:
=======================================================================

1. Token holder: Individual holding any amount of TRX.

2. Super Representative candidate: 100 individuals elected through voting by the entire token holder community. Elections are held once every 24 hours.

3. Super Representative: 27 individuals elected through voting by all token holders every 24 hours. Super Representatives play a key role in governing the TRON community by ensuring basic functions, e.g. block generation and bookkeeping, and obtain corresponding earnings.    Super Representatives can produce blocks and verify transactions. Meanwhile, Super Representatives can make an actual profit from creating blocks.

Super Representative Recommendations
====================================

Every token holder has the opportunity to become a TRON Super Representative. However, for the network and community to operate more smoothly and effectively, we have created a set of standards and regulations for eligible candidates to become recommended Super Representatives. We will promote recommended SRs to increase their chances of being elected. New recommended Super Representatives are updated and posted once a week.
