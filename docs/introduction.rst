TRON：Decentralize Internet Again
--------------------------------

TRON is dedicated to the basic construction and continual promotion of decentralized Internet. TRON protocol is one of the world’s largest decentralized application operation system protocol, which is based on blockchain and provides high-throughput, scalable, and highly-reliable underlying public-chain support for decentralized application. More application scenarios can be supported because of high TPS of TRON public chain, which exceeds tens of thousands. Besides, TRON public chain has greatly aroused enthusiasm of the ecological participants through the way of free using and high incentives. It not only meets the strict requirements of online decentralized entertainment applications that are highly concurrent, low calculation delay, and demanding much data transmission, and also delivers an amazing interactive decentralized user experience. Developers can develop their own and community applications by using TRON protocol and virtual machine. Smart contracts can be used for distributed crowdfunding and digital asset distribution. TRON protocol has been used to operate decentralized applications such as APP, Obike, Uplive, game.com, Kitty live, Mico and so on. The number of active users has exceeded 100 million, with distribution in over 100 countries around the world.

What is TRON?
------------

TRON operates as a decentralized blockchain platform for supporting smart contract and high throughput. TRON team sees it as a future operation system which allow developers deploying their own decentralized applications.

* Digital Asset Function with Chain Embedded
  Rather than simply stress "lacking in characteristics”, TRON mainly focus on user-friendliness of different functions. For example, after fully research of current market, the develop team of TRON found that there are many decentralized platform users who do not have programming skills but have rich intrinsic value. They cannot convert their intrinsic value into external entities because of high threshold and versatility of existed smart contract. This is the reason why TRON team embeds custom digital asset functions into the main chain instead of actualizing functions in the form of smart contracts. This can be more easily and directly to achieve a number of indicators such as user-friendliness, safety, and so on.

Web 3.0: Web 3.0: A Decentralized Application Platform
------------------------------------------------------

* Smart contract
* The Content of Delegated
* The Basic Rule of Consensus

  * Coin holders are required to vote for nodes in accordance to their tokens that have vote right. And nodes are elected what are known as witnesses based on votes and rules, which keep a balance between block-producing speed and the number of witness.
  * Meanwhile, voting users and nodes that are voted out will be paid for a certain sum of money for encouraging them to run for further elections.
  * Witnesses will produce valid blocks successively based on specific distribution rules and success to do so results in highest reward.
  * The vast majority of witnesses are chosen by votes and the rest will guarantee to be selected randomly under certain algorithm.
